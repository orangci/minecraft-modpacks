# minecraft-modpacks
My Minecraft modpacks managed with packwiz.

### juniper series
Modpacks for each season of the Juniper SMP. I did not use packwiz prior to season 10, so packwiz versions of previous seasons' modpacks do not exist. Naming scheme is `juniper-s10` (season 10 -> -s10).

- [juniper-s10](./juniper-s10): The Nix configuration which uses this modpack is [here](https://github.com/orangci/dots/blob/master/modules/server/minecraft/servers/juniper/season-10.nix). Completely server-side excepting the modflared mod, which is required on the client.

### frontera series
The frontera series are all versions of my frontera modpack, a client-sided utility, QoL, and optimisation focused pack. Naming scheme is `frontera217` (1.21.7 -> 217).

- [Frontera217](./frontera217): Frontera217 is additionally aimed towards working flawlessly with [juniper-s10](./juniper-s10).

<!-- ### client series
Miscellaneous client-sided modpacks.

- [Wynncraft](./wynncraft): This is frontera217 but with some wynncraft related utility mods added on top (e.g. wynntils).

### server series
Miscellaneous server-sided modpacks. -->
